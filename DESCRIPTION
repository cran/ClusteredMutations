Description: Identification and visualization of groups of closely spaced mutations in the DNA sequence of cancer genome. The extremely mutated zones are searched in the symmetric dissimilarity matrix using the anti-Robinson matrix properties. Different data sets are obtained to describe and plot the clustered mutations information.
