	abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in {DNA} maintenance, but many are of cryptic  origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

	abstract = {All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the {DNA} damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible.  Cancers with {BRCA}1 or {BRCA}2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex  relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis,"  was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at {TpC} dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous {DNA} damage can be dealt with by multiple repair/bypass pathways that  have overlapping specificities. We have used a frameshift reversion assay to examine spontaneous mutations that accumulate in yeast strains defective for the  high-fidelity nucleotide excision repair or recombination pathways. In contrast to the simple frameshift mutations that occur in wild-type strains, the reversion events in mutant strains are often complex in nature, with the selected frameshift mutation being accompanied by one or more base substitutions. Genetic  analyses demonstrate that the complex events are dependent on the Pol zeta translesion polymerase, thus implicating the {DNA} damage bypass activity of low-fidelity translesion polymerases in hypermutation phenomena.},

	abstract = {Mutations are typically perceived as random, independent events. We describe here nonrandom clustered mutations in yeast and in human cancers. Genome sequencing of yeast grown under chronic alkylation damage identified mutation clusters that extend up to 200 kb. A predominance of "strand-coordinated" changes of either cytosines or guanines in the same strand, mutation patterns, and genetic controls indicated that simultaneous mutations were generated by base alkylation in abnormally long single-strand {DNA} ({ssDNA}) formed at double-strand breaks ({DSBs}) and replication forks. Significantly, we found mutation clusters with analogous features in sequenced human cancers. Strand-coordinated clusters of mutated cytosines or guanines often resided near chromosome rearrangement breakpoints and were highly enriched with a motif targeted by {APOBEC} family cytosine-deaminases,  which strongly prefer {ssDNA}. These data indicate that hypermutation via multiple  simultaneous changes in randomly formed {ssDNA} is a general phenomenon that may be an important mechanism producing rapid genetic variation.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicate that a subclass of {APOBEC} cytidine deaminases, which convert cytosine to uracil during {RNA} editing and retrovirus or retrotransposon restriction, may induce mutation clusters in human tumors. We show here that throughout cancer genomes {APOBEC}-mediated mutagenesis is pervasive and correlates with {APOBEC} {mRNA} levels. Mutation clusters in whole-genome and exome data sets conformed to the stringent criteria indicative of an {APOBEC} mutation pattern. Applying these criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 exomes from 14 cancer types, mostly from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), showed a significant presence  of the {APOBEC} mutation pattern in bladder, cervical, breast, head and neck, and lung cancers, reaching 68\% of all mutations in some samples. Within breast cancer, the {HER}2-enriched subtype was clearly enriched for tumors with the {APOBEC} mutation pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis is functionally linked with cancer development. The {APOBEC} mutation pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes, implying that ubiquitous {APOBEC}-mediated mutagenesis is  carcinogenic.},

Caused by the problem's combinatorial nature, it is hard to solve for all but very small sets. Nevertheless, both exact solution methods and heuristics are available. In this paper we present the package seriation which provides an infrastructure for seriation with R. The infrastructure comprises data structures to represent linear orders as permutation vectors, a wide array of seriation methods using a consistent interface, a method to calculate the value of various loss and merit functions, and several visualization techniques which build on seriation. To illustrate how easily the package can be applied for a variety of applications, a comprehensive collection of examples is presented.},
